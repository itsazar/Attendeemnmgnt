Place your logo image here as `logo.png` so the app can load it at `/assets/logo.png`.

Recommended sizes:
- 280×108 PNG (wide header)
- Or provide a square 160×160 PNG; the layout will scale down.

Example (PowerShell):

mkdir public\assets
Copy-Item C:\path\to\your\logo.png public\assets\logo.png

If you want me to add the PNG for you, upload the binary into the workspace and I will write it to this folder.
